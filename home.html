        <h2>POWER OF JUSTICE </h2>
        <P>BY <STRONG>ALI RAZA MALIK</STRONG> | JULY 14,2025</P>
         <p>Justice is not just a principle — it's the backbone of any civilized society. It stands as a shield for the weak, a check on the powerful, and a promise that right will ultimately triumph over wrong.</p>

    <p>When justice prevails, peace follows. It gives people the confidence to live freely, knowing that fairness exists, and no one is above the law. In its absence, chaos begins to bloom — corruption thrives, and trust collapses.</p>

    <p>The true power of justice lies not in punishment, but in restoration — healing the broken, correcting the wrong, and setting things right. It’s about creating a world where equality isn't just a dream, but a reality.</p>

    <p>Whether in a courtroom, a classroom, or everyday life, standing for justice means standing for humanity. And the world always bends in favor of those who dare to speak for what’s right.</p>
